This table summarizes the average, for each activity and each subject, of the Mean and the Standard Division (STD) for each variable of the dataset collected by the experiment conducted by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See ‘Feature Selection‘ for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'Code_book.txt'

- 'average_good_table.txt': Shows the average, for each activity and each subject, of the Mean and the Standard Division (STD) for each variable of the dataset collected by the experiment conducted by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto. 

Feature Selection 
=================

The features (which are the column names of "average_good_table.txt") selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals Time Acceleration-XYZ and Time Gyro-XYZ. These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (Time Body Acceleration-XYZ and Time Gravity Acceleration -XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (Time Body Acceleration Jerk-XYZ and Time Body Gyro Jerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (Time Body Acceleration Magnitude, Time Gravity Acceleration Magnitude, Time Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude, Time Body Gyro Magnitude, Time Body Gyro Jerk Magnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing Freqyency Body Acceleration -XYZ, Freqyency Body Acceleration Jerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, Freqyency Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude, Frequency Body Gyro Magnitude, Frequency Body Gyro Jerk Magnitude.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Time Body Acceleration -XYZ
Time Gravity Acceleration -XYZ
Time Body Acceleration Jerk -XYZ
tBodyGyro -XYZ
Time Body Gyro Jerk -XYZ
Time Body Acceleration Magnitude
Time Gravity Acceleration Magnitude
Time Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude
Time Body Gyro Magnitude
Time Body Gyro Jerk Magnitude
Freqyency Body Acceleration -XYZ
Freqyency Body Acceleration Jerk -XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
Freqyency Body Acceleration Magnitude
Freqyency Body Acceleration Jerk Magnitude
Frequency Body Gyro Magnitude
Frequency Body Gyro Jerk Magnitude

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

Mean: Mean value
STD: Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
Time Body Acceleration Mean
Time Body Acceleration Jerk Mean
Time Body Gyro Mean
Time Body Gyro Jerk Mean
